# **EdTM** - Topic Collapsing in Embedding Spaces: An Application to Education Text

## **Description**

This research project evaluates the classic Latent Dirichlet (LDA) and neural topic modeling on education text, and further investigates the "topic collapsing" problem in [Dieng et al. (2020)’](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04907)s implementation of [the embedded topic model (ETM)](https://github.com/lffloyd/embedded-topic-model), with application to a novel corpus of research in the domain of Education. We highlighted aspects of the ETM’s behavior that suggest drawbacks of topic modeling in embedding spaces, as well as a potential solution to the topic collapsing problem.
